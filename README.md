# automatedUiTests
Placeholder for some sample Automated UI tests

- **InlineSeleniumTests** contains a couple of examples using _inline_ Selenium commdands.

- **SeleniumTests-AdditionalDemos** contains a more examples of different Selenium commands.

- **SeleniumTests-Demo-GoogleBasic-INLINE** contains an inline sample of the same set of tests as in the **PageObjectModel** example, but it uses inline commands. This pattern, over time will become difficult to maintiain as the test rig grows.

- **SeleniumTests-Demo-GoogleBasic-PageObjectModel** contains a simple example of using the **PageObjectModel** pattern, which can be used to make the test rig much easier to maintain. For a good overview of using the PageObjectModel pattern, see <https://www.guru99.com/page-object-model-pom-page-factory-in-selenium-ultimate-guide.html>
